# ARCHIVE SCRIPTS

Scripts included in this archive were used during earlier stages of my PhD work.

They are only here to provide transparency for my research.

**_I do NOT recommend trying to use them_** or adapt them. They are somewhat clunky
and probably quite difficult to follow, as they represent my first forays into
programming after a 25-year hiatus.

Elements of the scripts such as ```@edit_textgtrids``` and ```@fix_pitch``` are better
maintained in the main folder of my Praat=Scripts Github.
