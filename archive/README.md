# ARCHIVE SCRIPTS

Scripts included in this archive were used during earlier stages of my PhD work.

They are only here to provide transparency for my research.

I would no recommend trying to use them or adapt them. They are somewhat clunky
and probably quite difficult to follow, as they represent my first forays into
programming after a 25-year hiatus.

Elements of the scripts such as \@edit_textgtrids and \@fix_pitch are better
maintained in the main folder of my Praat=Scripts Github.
