# Praat-Scripts
Praat scripts I have written to make it easier to annotate and edit textgrids, perform acoustic analyses, and draw nice pictures.

I am by no means an expert, so there may be much better ways to achieve what I do in these scripts, but they generally do the job.

I'll slowly be making the scripts I currently use more other-people friendly.
The scripts can be divided into four types:
    1. Quality of Life Scripts
       This are scripts which basically make it generally easier to use Praat to analyis; e.g. for creating, editing, and saving
       textgrids
    2. Graphical scripts
       These do just what they say on the tin. They draw pretty pictures in the picture window.
    3. Analysis Scripts
       These are scripts that actually do some analysis.
    4. Procedures
       These are blocks of procedures to be included other scipts, and include graphical , objects management, and mathematical
       procedures. There may be more efficient ways of doing some of these things, but I probably didn't know how to when I
       was learning to script in Praat (which I still am, so be kind!)
